# Remaining API Endpoints

## Home (`/api/home`)
Aggregate home-page data endpoint. All routes require authentication (`CurrentUser`).

- `GET /api/home/` — Returns a `HomeResponse` combining all home-page sections in one request:
  - `featured` — Active `FeaturedItem`s (`start_at <= now <= end_at`), ordered by `priority` DESC. Each item embeds a full `MaterialDetail` including `current_version_info`.
  - `popular_today` — Top 8 root materials (no attachments) ordered by `views_today` DESC.
  - `popular_14d` — Top 8 root materials ordered by `views_14d` DESC (rolling 14-day counter).
  - `recent_prs` — 5 most recently opened `open` pull requests, with author hydrated.
  - `recent_favourites` — Current user's 6 most recently favourited materials, ordered by favourite `created_at` DESC.

- `GET /api/home/popular` — Paginated "see all" view for popular materials.
  - Query params: `period` (`"today"` | `"14d"`, default `"today"`), `limit` (1–50, default 20), `offset` (default 0)
  - Returns `list[MaterialDetail]` ordered by the selected counter DESC.
  - Only root materials (`parent_material_id IS NULL`) are included in both popularity endpoints.

Integration with OnlyOffice Document Server:
- `GET /api/onlyoffice/config/{material_id}` — Returns a signed document editor configuration
- `GET /api/onlyoffice/file/{material_id}` — File download endpoint called by OnlyOffice server

**Security model:**
- The editor config contains a JWT signed with `onlyoffice_jwt_secret` (shared with OnlyOffice)
- The file download URL contains a separate token signed with `onlyoffice_file_token_secret` (known only to the API)
- The file token has a short TTL (`onlyoffice_file_token_ttl`, default 60s)
- These two secrets MUST differ to prevent a compromised OnlyOffice container from forging file-download tokens

## Health
- `GET /api/health` — Returns `{"status": "ok"}` (no auth required)
- `GET /metrics` — Prometheus metrics (optional bearer token protection)
