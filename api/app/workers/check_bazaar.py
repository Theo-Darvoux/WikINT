"""Background ARQ worker: MalwareBazaar post-promotion check.

This worker is enqueued fire-and-forget by the upload pipeline immediately after
a file is promoted to ``cas/`` storage with status=CLEAN.  It performs the
MalwareBazaar hash lookup that was skipped in the hot path, then calls
``retroactive_quarantine`` if the file is flagged.

Design invariants
-----------------
* Idempotent: a Redis tombstone (``bazaar:clean:{sha256}``) prevents duplicate
  Bazaar calls for the same hash.  Re-uploads of the same file skip this worker
  entirely.
* Fail-closed/open: controlled by ``settings.malwarebazaar_fail_closed``.
  True  → timeout/error re-raises, ARQ retries up to 3×.
  False → timeout/error is logged and treated as "skip" (YARA remains the gate).
* No hard dependency on the scanner pool: falls back to a one-shot scanner when
  the context scanner is unavailable (e.g. in integration tests).
