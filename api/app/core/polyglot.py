"""Polyglot file detection.

A polyglot file is simultaneously valid under two or more format parsers.
Attackers use polyglots to bypass MIME-based security checks — for example,
a file that parses as a JPEG in the upload validator but as JavaScript when
rendered by a browser, or a JPEG with a ZIP archive appended at the end
(JZBOMB / JPEG+ZIP).

Checks performed by :func:`check_polyglot`:

1. **Header magic cross-check** — does the file start with magic bytes from a
   format incompatible with the declared MIME type?
2. **ZIP tail check** — ZIP archives always end with a 22-byte
   End-of-Central-Directory (EOCD) record starting with ``PK\\x05\\x06``.
   An image or PDF with a ZIP appended will contain this signature near its
   end, even though it begins with valid image/PDF magic bytes.
